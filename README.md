# spacemacs-config

This configuration is an example of how to use ESS and spacemacs. It features:

- ESS Key-bindings using evil's major-leader
- R-Markdown support with polymode
- RStudio like configuration of ESS

If this is interesting for you at all: first get familiar with Spacemacs!

# Install

I may change the config at any point: This is not a stable mirror!

```
git clone git@github.com:wahani/spacemacs-config.git spacemacs-config
sl ... private
sl ... .spacemacs
```
